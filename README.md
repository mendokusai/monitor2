# A NEW HOPE

---

This is new attempt to make a baby image monitor˚ using express and socket.io. It's shitty, but there we go: perfect parallel for a newborn.

## Setup

`npm install`

files save in a file named `stream` so you might want to make one of those.

`webpack-dev-server --progress --colors` to compile while you work.
**To be honest** that never worked well for me. I've been runing `webpack` without hot-loading to get my `bundle.js` and while it's an extra step, it beats some effort to *look* like it's working while doing FA.

`nodemon index.js <PORT>` port defaults to `3000`

visit `locahost:3000` to check it out.
